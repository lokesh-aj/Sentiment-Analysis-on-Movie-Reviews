# Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that classifies movie reviews as positive or negative based on sentiment. It involves data collection, text preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment to provide insights into audience sentiment.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Gather movie reviews from sources like IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Remove noise, normalize text, and prepare data.
- **Model Training**: Train models such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Evaluation**: Use accuracy and F1-score to assess model performance.
- **Deployment**: Provide insights for filmmakers and studios.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
